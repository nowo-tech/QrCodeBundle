2. **Create a new issue** with:
   - A descriptive title
   - Steps to reproduce the problem
   - Expected behavior vs. actual behavior
   - PHP, Symfony, and bundle versions
   - Screenshots if relevant

### Suggesting Enhancements

   - Detailed description of the proposed enhancement
   - Use cases and benefits
   - Possible implementations (if you have them)

### Contributing Code

#### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/QrCodeBundle.git
   cd QrCodeBundle
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # With Docker (recommended)
   make install
   
   # Without Docker
   composer install
   ```

#### Code Standards

The project follows these standards:

- **PSR-12**: PHP code style
- **PHP 8.2+**: Modern PHP features
- **Strict type hints**: `declare(strict_types=1);` in all files
- **PHP-CS-Fixer**: Used to maintain code consistency

**Before committing**:

```bash
# Install git hooks (strips accidental Cursor co-author trailers from messages)
make setup-hooks

# Verify git history has no Cursor co-author trailers (also runs in release-check)
make check-no-cursor-coauthor
```

```bash
# Check code style
make cs-check
# or
composer cs-check

# Fix code style automatically
make cs-fix
# or
composer cs-fix
```

#### Tests

**CI requires at least 95% code coverage** (`MIN_COVERAGE` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`). All tests must pass before merging. New features should include tests.

```bash
# Run all tests
make test
# or
composer test

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage
# or
composer test-coverage

# View coverage report
open coverage/index.html
```

**Test structure**:
- Tests should be in the `tests/` directory
- Each class should have its corresponding test
- Tests should be descriptive and cover edge cases
- Use mocks when appropriate
- **Maintain ≥95% coverage** — new features must include tests (`make test-coverage`)

#### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/my-bug-fix
   ```

2. **Make your changes**:
   - Write clean, well-documented code
   - Add tests for new features
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Run `make qa` to verify everything

3. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: description of feature"
   # or
   git commit -m "fix: description of fix"
   ```
   
   **Commit conventions**:
   - `feat:` New feature
   - `fix:` Bug fix
   - `docs:` Documentation changes
   - `test:` Add or modify tests
   - `refactor:` Code refactoring
   - `style:` Formatting changes (doesn't affect functionality)
   - `chore:` Maintenance tasks

4. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-new-feature
   ```

5. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub:
   - Clearly describe the changes
   - Mention any related issues
   - Add screenshots if relevant
   - Ensure CI passes

## Demos

This package does **not** currently ship a `demo/` tree. Demos are optional under the Nowo specs; when added, they must follow REQ-DEMO-* (FrankenPHP, path repo sync, smoke HTTP 200).

## Questions

If you have questions about contributing, you can:

- Open an issue on GitHub
- Contact the maintainers at hectorfranco@nowo.tech

## Acknowledgments

Thank you for contributing to QR Code Bundle. Your help makes this project better for everyone.
If CI fails because trailers are already on the remote, see [GITHUB_CI.md](GITHUB_CI.md) (REQ-GIT-001) and run `make strip-cursor-coauthor-from-history` before `git push --force-with-lease`.
